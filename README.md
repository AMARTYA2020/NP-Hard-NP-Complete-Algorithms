Contribute by Amartya Pandey

Basically NP hard and NP complete are basic guidelines to be followed for any Algorithmic enthusiasts for solving a exponential time taking famous algorithms to polynomial complextiy atleast......
I have compiled my handwritten NP guideline notes...took a lot of time and resources to compile and extrat the needful notes:)
